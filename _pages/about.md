## Welcome!

I am Saima Gaffar, a researcher specializing in bioinformatics, protein language models, 
and machine learning for biological sequence analysis.

My work focuses on:
- Transcription factor identification  
- Large protein language models (pLMs)  
- Drug–protein interaction modeling  
- Computational peptide analysis  

I completed my Ph.D. at Jeonbuk National university, South Korea, and I currently work on developing AI-driven tools 
for biological discovery.

Feel free to explore my publications and CV.
