## Welcome!

Welcome! I am Saima Gaffar, a researcher working at the intersection of bioinformatics, artificial intelligence, and computational biology. My work centers on leveraging modern machine learning — particularly protein language models (pLMs) — to decode information hidden within biological sequences and enable data-driven insights into molecular systems.

I completed my Ph.D. at Jeonbuk National University (South Korea), where I designed cutting-edge AI approaches for biological sequence analysis. My doctoral dissertation, titled “Computational Identification of Transcription Factors and Methylation-Specific Binding Preferences Using Machine Learning,” was carried out under the supervision of Professor Kil To Chong and co-advised by Professor Hilal Tayara.

Before my Ph.D., I earned both of my degrees from the University of Kashmir (India):

*M.Tech in Computer Science, where I deepened my understanding of machine learning, deep learning, and computational modeling. During this period, I completed my thesis on image segmentation, which introduced me to applying AI techniques to real-world pattern recognition problems.
*B.Tech in Computer Science & Engineering, which helped me build a strong foundation in core computer science concepts, programming, algorithms, and system design. It was during this time that I first developed an interest in using computational methods to address scientific challenges.

My broader research goal is to build interpretable, efficient, and biologically meaningful computational tools that accelerate discovery in genomics, proteomics, and molecular medicine.

I build computational frameworks in bioinformatics with a strong emphasis on machine learning, deep learning, and protein language models. My work revolves around:
🚀 Transcription Factor Identification & Interpretation using transformer-based architectures
🧬 Protein Language Models (pLMs) for extracting rich, biologically meaningful sequence embeddings
💊 Drug–Protein Interaction Modeling to support rational therapeutic discovery
🧪 Peptide Function Prediction, including activity, mechanisms, and target specificity
