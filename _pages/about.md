## Welcome!

Welcome! I am Saima Gaffar, a researcher working at the intersection of bioinformatics, artificial intelligence, and computational biology. My work centers on leveraging modern machine learning — particularly protein language models — to decode information hidden within biological sequences and enable data-driven insights into molecular systems.

Throughout my research career, I have focused on developing computational frameworks for:

Identifying and interpreting transcription factors using transformer-based architectures

Applying large protein language models (pLMs) to extract meaningful sequence embeddings

Modeling drug–protein interactions to support therapeutic design

Predicting the functional and biochemical behavior of peptides, including activity and target specificity

I completed my Ph.D. at Jeonbuk National University in South Korea, where I designed and evaluated cutting-edge AI approaches for biological sequence analysis. My broader research goal is to build interpretable and efficient computational tools that can accelerate discovery in genomics, proteomics, and molecular medicine.

Feel free to explore my publications and CV to learn more about my work, collaborations, and future research interests.
